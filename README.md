# Covid-19-Treatment-Data-Analysis
Covid-19 Treatment &amp; Data Analysis systems are designed to meet the health care needs of COVID-19 affected persons. Especially in our country we don't have many doctors and medical instruments to face the large number of patients. So in this situation itâ€™s not even possible to treat the patients specifically for their specific syndromes with other health issues. Whoever has major health issues he/she must need a specific treatment to overcome this situation.   So we decided to make a web application that will collect data from recovered patients via online survey then analyze the report and suggest a better treatment for new patients with their specific health issues and syndromes. In the doctors panel doctors will review the prescription generated by application then make changes if required and send to patients email. This process will make the covid treatment more faster and easier so we can save more people's lives. Also by using this application anyone can get the treatment via online and stay safe at home, That will help to decrease the virus spread as well.
